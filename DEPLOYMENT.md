# Azure Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your application is now ready for Azure deployment! All issues have been resolved:

- ✅ Removed Cosmos DB dependency (no connection string errors)
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Simplified to in-memory storage
- ✅ LinkedIn OAuth properly configured
- ✅ Production-ready security settings
- ✅ Terraform infrastructure already configured

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Azure deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the application
   - Deploy to Azure App Service
   - Use the existing publish profile

### Option 2: Manual Azure Deployment

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create deployment package:**
   ```bash
   mkdir deploy
   cp -r dist/* deploy/
   cp -r server deploy/
   cp package.json deploy/
   cd deploy && zip -r ../deployment.zip .
   ```

3. **Upload to Azure App Service** via Azure Portal

### Option 3: Azure CLI Deployment

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Deploy the app
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group aon-lead-app-rg \
  --name aon-lead-app-eastus2-1 \
  --src deployment.zip
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Already Configured)

Your Terraform configuration has already set these in Azure App Service:

```
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID = "784jsddghxw155"
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET = "WPL_AP1.iIRvkzWg2nzBCEyD.PsS8sg=="
BASE_URL = "https://aon-lead-app-eastus2-1.azurewebsites.net"
NODE_ENV = "production"
SESSION_SECRET = "your-production-secret-key"
```

## 📋 Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these work:

1. **Visit your app:** https://aon-lead-app-eastus2-1.azurewebsites.net
2. **Test LinkedIn login**
3. **Complete the lead form**
4. **Check the dashboard**
